    Base class for JSGF rules.

    Rule names can be a single word containing one or more alphanumeric Unicode
    characters and/or any of the following special characters: +-:;,=|/\()[]@#%!^&~$

    For example, the following are valid rule names:
    hello
    ZÃ¼rich
    user_test
    $100
    1+2=3

    There are two reserved rule names: NULL and VOID. These reserved names cannot be
    used as rule names. You can however change the case to 'null' or 'void' to use
    them, as names are case-sensitive.
